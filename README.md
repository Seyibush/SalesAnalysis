# SalesAnalysis

This project leverages the Python Pandas and Python Matplotlib libraries to conduct a comprehensive analysis and address pertinent business inquiries regarding sales data spanning a period of twelve months. The dataset encompasses a substantial volume of electronics store transactions, categorized by month, product type, cost, purchase address, and other relevant attributes.

### Problem statement
- Which month recorded the highest sales revenue? What was the total revenue generated during that month?
- Which city had the highest product sales volume?
- At what time should we strategically display advertisements to optimize the probability of customers making purchases?
- Which products are frequently purchased together?
- Which product had the highest sales volume? What factors do you believe contributed to its success?
